A FE-focused take-home exercise for https://mobilizeamerica.io. It consumes the Mobilize Events API and uses it to display a simple listing of public campaign events and a map of those events.

It was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`. To run it locally:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`

It can also be tested with `yarn test` and built for production deploy with `yarn build`.

See [overview.txt](overview.txt) for a summary of the structure and intended improvements.
